# Twitter_CDC_Hadoop

Created a data processing pipeline to extract and aggregate tweets and articles from Twitter/NY Times specific to the 2017-2018 Influenza Flu season. Wrote MapReduce jobs to discern word count and co-occurences of tags and visualized the analysis using D3.js to monitor real time disease activity using location specific key-words.
