suspiciously like a liberal wish list involving extensive government But there are signs that those attitudes are slowly Both solar and wind which have always been broadly are growing fastest in many states a trend that could do far more than endless scientific reports to break the deadlock around climate Advertisement place where I often tend to find common ground is when we can agree on said if someone supports the growth of clean does it matter why they support On that the Trump administration is less likely to rethink its Support for renewable energy and action on climate change often

promises to halt global warming into something a bit more Most countries say pushing forward on the issue even without the Trump administration has rejected the Paris climate But as we found this easier said than One of the strangest dynamics at the Bonn climate talks so far has been the fact that everyone is trying to pretend the Trump administration really A whole bunch of American like Al Gore and Michael have showed up this week to loudly insist that dismissal of climate policy really represent the country writ that plenty of cities and states are still doing their part to cut emissions and that Americans still very much want to tackle this as a message the rest of the world seems eager to accept at least on the Whenever asked diplomats from other countries about the United far more interested in talking about California or New York than about They want to believe that the United States is opposed to action on global rather see the Trump administration as an you speak about the United you speak about a not only a Miguel Arias commissioner for climate told us this there is real action on the ground in the United One thing curious about as we cover these talks is whether this new equilibrium can been seeing signs of On Trump administration officials showed up to reiterate that they were still leaving the Paris agreement and that the rest of the world was in thinking fossil fuels could be phased out quickly or easily It was by far the most attended and event at with hundreds of people waiting in line to get in And George David international energy made it clear that the White not Democratic governors like Jerry Brown or Andrew spoke for When asked about the fact that blue states committed to tackling climate change represented 130 million he shrugged it represent something like 300 million other countries are going to have to figure out which America dealing one of the questions trying to Can the rest of the world treat Trump like a mere blip in the longer arc of global efforts to tackle climate Or will they start to believe that his rejection of a global deal represents something bigger that an America deeply divided on climate change is

the Earth has been through a series of ice The last one ended about years as the atmosphere warmed by 7 to 9 degrees Fahrenheit over about The end of that ice age ushered in the current geological known as the Holocene Despite some episodes of minor warming and the climate has been relatively But as industrialization since the 19th century has led to a 40 percent increase in carbon dioxide in
